# Project 7: Tic-Tac-Toe

**Teacher**: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 7 and its corresponding labs for the MHS Software Engineering class. This project focuses on creating a Tic-Tac-Toe program in Python. This is your main assessment task for this unit.
Leading up to this project you will be guided through a Connect Four program which contains similar skills.

## Main Project: Tic Tac Toe
- **File**: [`tic-tac-toe.py`](tic-tac-toe.py)
- **Description**: As a software engineer, you are tasked to design and develop a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. You will work through each stage of the software development cycle while demonstrating your skills with concepts such as data types and structures, input validation, functions, loops, and lists.

## Labs: Connect FOur
- **File**: [`connect-four.py`](connect-four.py)
- **Description**: We are going to walk through the development of a 'Connect Four' game to give you the skills to complete your Tic Tac Toe assessment. Connect Four is a game in which the players choose a coluor and then take turns dropping coloured tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
